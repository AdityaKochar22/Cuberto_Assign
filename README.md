# Cuberto App Clone Assignment ( Some Sections)
## Overview
This project is a partial recreation of the Cuberto App, focusing on three main sections:

1. What We Do – Interactive 3D rotating image with text and a button
2. Feed/Project Section – Carousel effect for text and draggable project cards
3. Contact Us – Background visual effect using a 3D video design

## Features & Implementation
<b>1. What We Do Section</b>
Initially attempted a 3D rotating "C" using Three.js but faced challenges.
Instead, implemented a 3D image of a letter with X-axis rotation (horizontal plane).
The button features a hover effect, where the background and text color change dynamically.<br><br>
<b>2. Feed/Project Section</b>
Implemented a carousel-like effect for text and small videos moving right to left in the page header.
The project content section includes draggable project cards, allowing users to scroll horizontally.<br><br>
<b>3. Contact Us Section</b>
Initially tried to create a background image using Three.js, but due to challenges, switched to a 3D video design.
The video was integrated into the background with proper opacity and visual balance for an appealing effect.

## Tech Stack Used
1. HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript( React.js)
2. Three.js (initial attempts for 3D effects)
3. CSS & JavaScript for animations and interactions
